# Overview
Coronavirus (COVIDâ€‘19) is spreading fast. Since first reported in December 2019, by mid-January 2021, it has affected more than 95 million people and killed more than 2 million people worldwide. To aid the analysis and inform public health decision making, machine learning models trained on real data can be very useful. In this assignment, you are to build and compare predictive models using machine learning algorithms and epidemiological data from the COVID-19 outbreak.

## Task specification
- To explore the dataset and define ONE problem you want to solve, with motivations.
- To choose any 3 machine learning algorithms (not necessarily from the lectures in this module) that are sophisticated and appropriate to solve the problem.
- To build 3 predictive models and make comparisons between them.
- To write a scientific report (in a style of an academic paper).

## Abstract of my paper
The spread of covid-19 has put a strain on the hospitals and medical sector all over the world. As the number of covid-19 patients rise and medical facilities encounter shortages in ICU capacities, it is inevitable to develop a triage system for covid-19 patients based on evidence of how vulnerable patients are. This paper aims to predict on an individual level which covid-19 cases are the most likely to end fatally and therefore should be prioritized for hospital admission or a space at ICU. 
The algorithms that were used to evaluate the data are Logistic Regression, K-nearest-neighbour and Random Forest Classification.
