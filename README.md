# Overview
Coronavirus (COVID‑19) is spreading fast. Since first reported in December 2019, by mid-January 2021, it has affected more than 95 million people and killed more than 2 million people worldwide. To aid the analysis and inform public health decision making, machine learning models trained on real data can be very useful. In this assignment, you are to build and compare predictive models using machine learning algorithms and epidemiological data from the COVID-19 outbreak.

## Task specification
• To explore the dataset and define ONE problem you want to solve, with motivations.
• To choose any 3 machine learning algorithms (not necessarily from the lectures in this
module) that are sophisticated and appropriate to solve the problem.
• To build 3 predictive models and make comparisons between them.
• To write a scientific report (in a style of an academic paper).
